The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application built with Spring Boot (backend) and React.js (frontend) to manage employee records. It allows users to perform basic CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—on employee data such as first name, last name, and email. The system is connected to a MySQL database for data storage and integrates logging using SLF4J for monitoring API interactions.

Key Features
Create: Add new employee records.
Read: Fetch all employees or a specific employee by ID.
Update: Modify existing employee details.
Delete: Remove employee records from the system.
CORS Handling: Configured CORS in Spring Boot to allow frontend communication.
Frontend Integration: Developed a user-friendly React.js interface for seamless interaction.
